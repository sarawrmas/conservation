    <h2>7 Principles</h2>
    <figure>
      <blockquote cite="https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/">
        "The Seven Principles of Leave No Trace provide an easily understood framework
        of minimum impact practices for anyone visiting the outdoors. Although
        Leave No Trace has its roots in backcountry settings, the Principles
        have been adapted so that they can be applied anywhere — from remote
        wilderness areas, to local parks and even in your own backyard.
        They also apply to almost every recreational activity. Each Principle covers
        a specific topic and provides detailed information for minimizing impacts.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Seven Principles are well established and widely known, but they
        are not static. The Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics continually
        examines, evaluates and reshapes the Principles. The Center’s Education
        Department conducts research — including publishing scholarly articles
        in independent journals — to ensure that the Principles are up to
        date with the latest insights from biologists, land managers and other
        leaders in outdoor education."

      <h3>1. Plan Ahead & Prepare</h3>
      <p>
        Having a plan helps travelers and the land alike.
        By considering adverse weather, terrain, and travel routes,
        you can be prepared with the proper equipment and guidance
        to keep yourself, and your surroundings, safe and unmarred.

      <h3>2. Travel & Camp on Durable Surfaces</h3>
      <p>
        Stay on the established path. By doing so, you can preserve surrounding
        plant life and make less impact on wildlife that relies on the land
        for survival. Straying from the path may cause erosion, endangerment
        of local flora and fauna, and increases your likelihood of getting lost!

      <h3>3. Dispose of Waste Properly</h3>
      <p>
        Pack it in, pack it out. Carry all of your disposables with you until you
        can find a proper bin to discard. Doing so keeps our forests clean and
        clear of unsightly litter, and ensures the safety of plants and wildlife
        from human impact.

      <h3>4. Leave What You Find</h3>
      <p>
        Leave nothing but footprints, take nothing but pictures. When departing
        from a campsite, leave it exactly as you found it. When hiking, do not
        disturb plants, rocks, artifacts, or park property. Help the environment
        and other hikers by leaving the outdoors untouched.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Minimize Campfire Impacts</h3>
      <p>
        It is up to you to determine fire safety. Follow your local guidelines.
        If traveling in a dry area, consider skipping the fire. If a campfire is
        deemed safe to start, use existing fire rings, never leave a fire
        unattended, and make sure fire is completely out before departing.

      <h3>6. Respect Wildlife</h3>
      <p>
        Protect yourself and wildlife by keeping a distance.
        Educate yourself on the wildlife that exists in your area, and know
        what to do in an encounter. Do not, under any circumstances,
        feed the wildlife! It endangers you, the animals, and other visitors.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Be Considerate of Other Visitors</h3>
      <p>
        Always remember that you are not the only one trying to enjoy the
        outdoors. Maintain courtesy of others by keeping noise to a minimum,
        moving to the side for uphill hikers when traveling downhill, and
        making your presence known if approaching from behind.
